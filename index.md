## About Me

I am an undergraduate at Vellore Institute of Technology Chennai, specializing in Computer Science and Engineering. My current research focus is on **Efficient Dense Retrievers**, conducted under the supervision of Prof. Nirav Bhatt at the Department of Data Science and AI. 

In addition to this, I collaborate with Prof. Amiatava Das at AIISC (University of South Carolina) on projects involving **multimodal alignment and hallucination mitigation**.

Recently, I began an internship at Carnegie Mellon University under the guidance of Prof. Anand Rao, where I will be contributing to research in **Agentic Systems and Evaluation**.

## Research Interests

- **Natural Language Processing:** information Retrieval, reasoning, qa systems
- **Machine Learning:** alignment, hallucinations, multimodality

## News

- **[Feb. 2025]** Our dataset paper on text to video hallucinations has been accepted to TrustNLP@NAACL.
